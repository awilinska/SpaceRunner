Hi!

This is my project of simple, endless-runner game with space, retrofuture vibe. 

I'm still working on this project in my freetime, so there will be updates.

All of graphic assets are made by me, you can check out mi PixilArt profile:

You can play the current version of the game on Unity Play:

Have fun!
